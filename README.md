Reflection
This is first time i have worked on graphql and apolo as it was challenging to get data.So need to go through many refrence documents to create initial setup.But it was really good learning experience.

What were some unexpected obstacles:- Unit test was challenging as I was new to graphql I try to add some unit test case but unable to finish.
